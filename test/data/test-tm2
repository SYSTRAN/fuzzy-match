TEST0	But neither politicians nor scientists should be controlled by the interests of the powerful financial groups that have been harassing us constantly , here and in Brussels , for weeks .	0.5	true	2	
TEST1	The experts must work completely objectively and transparently , in a peaceful environment , and they must give us reliable and objective answers .	0.5	true	2	
TEST2	I will not hide from you that this week I received a very interesting report from the Scientific and Technical Committee for the Multifactorial Study of Disorders of Bees , which is made up of eminent scientists .	0.5	true	2	
TEST3	That report officially records the presence of doses of substances I previously mentioned as having been found in pollen .	0.5	true	2	
TEST4	It has been reported to me that the firm Bayer itself , naming no names , was astonished by this new evidence .	0.5	true	2	
TEST5	To quote just one of these findings : the use of Gaucho for pelleting sunflower seed results in a significant risk for bees of different ages .	0.5	true	2	
TEST6	As with sunflower , the concentration ratio for the Gaucho pelleting of maize seed proves worrying given the consumption of pollen .	0.5	true	2	
TEST7	Having said that , Commissioner , there is an urgent need for action to establish the real causes of the worrying rate of mortality among bees .	0.5	true	2	
TEST8	In the meantime , our beekeepers need help , more funds to cope with this new crisis , whatever its origin .	0.5	true	2	
TEST9	I hope that the Commission will move this time , that it will take our demands seriously , that it will see that serious studies are made to get to the bottom of this crisis .	0.5	true	2	
TEST10	Meanwhile , as I said , we must take measures to prevent the disappearance of beekeepers with all the harmful ecological consequences that this would entail .	0.5	true	2	
TEST11	That is why , Commissioner , we are asking the Commission to kindly give a clear answer to the three specific questions we have put to you in the course of this debate .	0.5	true	2	
TEST12	Mr President , I have been well aware of your commitment to this subject for a long time , Mrs Lulling , and of your competence and strength of feeling .	0.5	true	2	
TEST13	In addressing me , you said these concerns were also felt in the country of which I am still a citizen .	0.5	true	2	
TEST14	I do also understand , from the words you used , your dissatisfaction and your expectations .	0.5	true	2	
TEST15	Nevertheless , that is a long way from saying that we are trying to sidestep the issue , that we are turning a deaf ear or that we have lost the plot .	0.5	true	2	
TEST16	So I am going to try and give a serious and lucid answer to your three questions .	0.5	true	2	
TEST17	However , the Commission wishes to stress that any such effect is already taken into account in the evaluation of insecticides required under the directive on the placing of plant protection products on the market .	0.5	true	2	
TEST18	Member States are not allowed to authorise a plant protection product if it has an unacceptable effect on non-target organisms such as bees .	0.5	true	2	
TEST19	Moreover , an assessment of any possible effect of residues on public health is a prior condition for setting maximum levels of pesticide residues in food .	0.5	true	2	
TEST20	The Commission notes that most of the concerns expressed in this regard relate to two insecticides that are currently being evaluated , Mrs Lulling .	0.5	true	2	
TEST21	Regarding investigations into this subject , the directive does not require the studies to be conducted by the Commission itself .	0.5	true	2	
TEST22	On the other hand , the Commission is fully informed of the studies necessary in order to demonstrate the acceptability of particular substances .	0.5	true	2	
TEST23	It has been provided with information on the decline in bee populations in some Member States , as you yourself have solemnly emphasised .	0.5	true	2	
TEST24	At present , we are told , there is no scientific proof that this decline is due to a single factor such as pesticide use .	0.5	true	2	
TEST25	The Commission is also informed of research currently being undertaken by the Member States , by industry and by scientific associations under the watchful eye of the associations .	0.5	true	2	
TEST26	The Commission is itself following the matter very closely .	0.5	true	2	
TEST27	It will , of course , continue to monitor developments and will take appropriate measures in due course should that appear necessary .	0.5	true	2	
TEST28	The French programme , for example , included a study of the effects of plant protection products on bees .	0.5	true	2	
TEST29	The programmes for the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 marketing years also provide aids for the reconstitution of bee stocks .	0.5	true	2	
TEST30	Those are the most definite and most precise answers I can give you on the three points raised in your oral question .	0.5	true	2	
TEST31	Mr President , Commissioner , we all know that Mrs Lulling is not only the European Parliament 's queen of wine but also its queen bee .	0.5	true	2	
TEST32	I should like to thank her very warmly for this commitment , because we should be aware that this has been a matter of concern to the European Parliament for decades .	0.5	true	2	
TEST33	Back in the 1980s , the Bavarian Member of Parliament and pan-European , Heinrich Aigner , who sadly is no longer with us , brought together hundreds of Bavarian beekeepers to inject some impetus into this issue .	0.5	true	2	
TEST34	We have been working on it for 30 years , and unfortunately we have not made a great deal of progress .	0.5	true	2	
TEST35	That is why I really believe that now is the time to promote something that is under serious threat , namely passing on beekeeping to the next generation .	0.5	true	2	
TEST36	I should particularly like to thank you , Commissioner , for your examples from France , which plays a leading role in this sector .	0.5	true	2	
TEST37	Your country also has a former agriculture minister for president and it is a country , which , thank God , takes healthy eating and delicious food very seriously .	0.5	true	2	
TEST38	Quite extraordinary problems of declining bee colonies have been observed in France for several years now , since 1995 to be precise .	0.5	true	2	
TEST39	It seems on investigation that this bee mortality is not the result of a conventional pathology .	0.5	true	2	
TEST40	Several other hypotheses have been examined , such as climate , general pollution or the incorrect use of plant protection products .	0.5	true	2	
TEST41	While these may sometimes carry some of the responsibility , however , they are far from accounting for the full scale of the disaster .	0.5	true	2	
TEST42	On this point I do not agree with the opinion you have just expressed , Commissioner .	0.5	true	2	
TEST43	The more observations are made , the more these findings are confirmed .	0.5	true	2	
TEST44	That is why , again at the instigation of Dominique Souchet and Astrid Lulling , the European Parliament 's Committee on Agriculture arranged a hearing on the subject on 28 April last .	0.5	true	2	
TEST45	Gaucho and Regent molecules could therefore be harmful not only to bees but to a much wider environment .	0.5	true	2	
TEST46	Let us not stop there , either .	0.5	true	2	0.5	8407=Ne manquons pas cette occasion .	0.5	8521=N ' abandonnons pas les Sahraouis .
TEST47	Since these molecules are present in agricultural products used in food or animal feed , we should also be concerned about our own health .	0.5	true	2	
TEST48	That is why , faced with this risk of widespread poisoning of the ecosystem - and perhaps of man - we are insisting that the precautionary principle be applied .	0.5	true	2	
TEST49	I heard the Commission 's answers to Mr Souchet 's and Mrs Lulling 's oral question just now .	0.5	true	2	
TEST50	I believe it is taking too much of a wait-and-see attitude .	0.5	true	2	
TEST51	In our view , the precautionary principle means banning the use of the products in question , at least on all honey plants .	0.5	true	2	
TEST52	Measures should also be taken to compensate beekeepers and enable them to repopulate their hives .	0.5	true	2	
TEST53	Mr President , I will respond briefly to the few comments that have been made .	0.5	true	2	
TEST54	Contrary to what may have been said , the Commission takes very seriously this question that Mrs Lulling has vehemently and competently defended and that Mr Souchet put with her .	0.5	true	2	
TEST55	Work on the substances in question has been going on for several years .	0.5	true	2	
TEST56	The International Commission on Plant-Bee Relations , whose particular brief it is to examine the dangers threatening bees , has just held an international symposium in Bologna on the subject .	0.5	true	2	
TEST57	Its findings are that the deterioration in the health of bees and the reduced performance of colonies observed in a number of countries probably do not have such a simple , single cause .	0.5	true	2	
TEST58	You mentioned the ecosystem , Mr Berthu .	0.5	true	2	
TEST59	I would remind you that I have a longstanding commitment in this area .	0.5	true	2	
TEST60	As a former environment minister in my country , I am sensitive to this question .	0.5	true	2	
TEST61	The symposium agreed to form a working party to look into the deteriorating health of bees .	0.5	true	2	
TEST62	The working party will report to the next symposium , which will be held in 2005 .	0.5	true	2	
TEST63	I confirm that the Commission will be following this work closely and will draw a number of definite conclusions from it .	0.5	true	2	
TEST64	Mr Posselt , whom I thank for his opinion , regretted that fewer and fewer young people are taking up this wonderful rural occupation of beekeeping .	0.5	true	2	
TEST65	I simply want to confirm that national programmes concerning honey provide funding for technical assistance to encourage young people to become beekeepers and improve their results .	0.5	true	2	
TEST66	Thank you , Commissioner .	0.5	true	2	0.71420002	12146=Merci beaucoup , Monsieur le Commissaire .	0.71420002	13905=Merci beaucoup , Monsieur le Commissaire !
TEST67	Mrs Lulling wishes to provide the sting in the tail .	0.5	true	2	
TEST68	Mr President , the Commissioner has said that the Commission has no scientific proof of the correlation between bee mortality and the use of new generation pesticides .	0.5	true	2	
TEST69	The debate is closed .	0.5	true	2	0.833299994	4924=La discussion commune est close .	0.833299994	4961=La discussion commune est close .

TEST73	Mr President , I do not want to delay the House , but it would inappropriate if I did not mark that particular announcement on behalf of the whole House .	0.5	true	2	
TEST74	Lord Bethell has been a popular and hard-working Member of this House for very many years .	0.5	true	2	
TEST75	His service has been appreciated by all sides of the House .	0.5	true	2	
TEST76	We recall his work on human rights in the Soviet Union when it was at the height of its powers .	0.5	true	2	
TEST77	He brought the plights of Solzhenitsyn and Sakharov to widespread public attention .	0.5	true	2	
TEST78	This Parliament 's Sakharov Prize is something he played a key role in instituting .	0.5	true	2	
TEST79	He also had a direct role in air liberalisation , so he has had a direct effect upon consumers throughout the European Union .	0.5	true	2	
TEST80	I believe that every politician would hope to be in a position in which , in their lifetime , they could have made at least some difference on behalf of their constituents .	0.5	true	2	
TEST81	For the people of Europe , Lord Bethell can say that he has been a politician who has made a difference .	0.5	true	2	
TEST82	He will be greatly missed by all sides of the House .	0.5	true	2	
TEST83	I should also like to inform the House that Mrs Maij-Weggen has been appointed Royal Commissioner for North Brabant Province in the Netherlands .	0.5	true	2	
TEST84	She has informed me of her resignation with effect from 1 October 2003 .	0.5	true	2

TEST90	President .	0.5	true	2	
TEST91	That concludes the vote .	0.5	true	2	0.800000012	19462=Le débat est clos .
TEST92	The von Wogau report therefore proposes regulating arms exports and making them more ethical .	0.5	true	2	
TEST93	One might as well try to make murder , plunder or abduction more ethical .	0.5	true	2	
TEST94	The simple fact that the great powers are wasting enormous sums of money on weapons of mass destruction shows that the present organisation of society is barbaric .	0.5	true	2
