# Using the FuzzyMatch-cli

`FuzzyMatch-cli` is a commandline utility allowing to compile FuzzyMatch indexes and use them to lookup fuzzy matches.

## Compiling a Fuzzy match index

Simplest command is the following:
```
FuzzyMatch-cli -c CORPUS [--penalty-tokens (none|tag,sep/jnr,pct,cas,nbr)] [--max-tokens-in-pattern N] [--filter-type (suffix-array|bm25)] [--bm25-ratio-idf BM25_IDF_RATIO]
```

* `CORPUS` can be a single file - in which case, the index of each segment is simply the sentence id - or you can provide a target file using `-c CORPUSSOURCE,CORPUSTARGET` and add option `--add-target` to include in the index the actual target sentence (format ID=target). This is useful for having the index fully containing the translation memory. Not useful, if the translation memory is saved in side database.
* `--penalty-tokens` (default `tag,cas,nbr`) is either `none` or comma-separated list of `tag`, `sep`, `jnr`, `pct`, `nbr`, `cas` modifying normalization (for `cas` performing case normalization, and `nbr` triggering number normalization), removing some tokens from index (`tag` for tags, and `pct` for punctuations), or generates spacer/joiner (`sep`/`jnr`). In each case, a penalty tokens is added.
* `--max-tokens-in-pattern` (default: 300) limits how long the pattern can be. This is necessary to prevent poor match performance, because the edit distance computation runs in O(T^2) where T is the number of tokens in the pattern.
* `--filter-type` switch between `suffix-array` or `bm25` (default `suffix-array`).
* `BM25IDFRATIO` (default: 0.5) prefilter to fasten BM25. The value is in (0, 1) and corresponds to the maximum ratio of sentences in memory containing a certain term before building a reverse index for this term. Reasonable ratios can easily be around 0.1, which implies that indexed terms are in at most 10% of the sentences.

This option used in index forces the same logic in matching.

The above command generates a file `CORPUS.fmi`.

## Fuzzy Lookup

```
FuzzyMatch-cli -i CORPUS.fmi -a match -f FUZZY -N NTHREAD -n NMATCH --filter-type FILTERTYPE [--ml ML] [--mr MR] [--bm25-buffer BM25BUFF] [--bm25-cutoff BM25CUTOFF] --idf-penalty IDFPENALTYRATIO --insert-cost ICOST --delete-cost DCOST --replace-cost RCOST --contrast CONTRASTFACTOR --contrast-buffer CONTRASTBUFF < INPUTFILE > MATCHES 
```

* `CORPUS.fmi` path to the complete generated index file
* `FUZZY`, the fuzzy threshold in [0,1]. Not really relevant < 0.5.
* `NTHREAD` number of thread to use - default 4. Scales well with the number of threads.
* `NMATCH` number of match to return.
* `FILTERTYPE` switch between `suffix-array` or `bm25` (default `suffix-array`).
* `ML` minimal length of the longest subsequence (in tokens) - defaut 3. If the pattern size is strictly less than `ML`, then this parameter is ignored.
* `MR` minimal ratio of the longest subsequence (in tokens) - default 0. Interesting to use for lowest fuzzy - for instance a value of 0.5, used with fuzzy threshold 0.5, will guarantee the presence of at least 50% of the sentence length.
* `BM25BUFF` number of best BM25 to rerank with edit distance. The default is 10.
* `BM25CUTOFF` minimum BM25 score threshold cutoff. The default is 0.
* `IDFPENALTYRATIO` if not null, gives extra penalty to word missing weighted on IDF: a value of 1 is equivalent to give a penalty of one additional missing word for a word appearing only once in all the translation memory.
* `ICOST`, `DCOST`, `RCOST`, positive real values, respectively costs for *insertion*, *deletion* and *replace* in the edit distance. The default are 1, 1, 1. For coverage similarity, choose 1, 0, 1.
* `CONTRAST` contrastive factor for iterative contrastive retrieval (see [paper](https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-main.235/)). Default is 0. The greater, the more diversity in the retrieved sequences.
* `CONTRASTBUFF` contrastive buffer (default `NMATCH`, only useful when `CONTRAST`>0) is the number of candidates with highest matches considered for contrastive reranking. If not set, it will just rerank the `NMATCH` scores.

Add `--no-perfect` (`-P`) to discard perfect matches. For instance the following command returns one fuzzy match higher than 0.7 but not perfect:

```
FuzzyMatch-cli -l en -i CORPUS.fmi -a match -f 0.7 -N 4 -n 1 -P < INPUTFILE
```

# The Algorithm
## Tokenization and Vocabulary Indexing

All the sentences stored in the Fuzzy Match index are considered as sequences of index - where the index is coming from a vocabulary list as defined in `VocabIndexer`.

It is therefore important to tokenize and normalize the sentences stored. Default integrated tokenization is OpenNMT tokenization:

```
onmt::Tokenizer tokenizer(onmt::Tokenizer::Mode::Aggressive,
                          onmt::Tokenizer::Flags::CaseFeature
                          | onmt::Tokenizer::Flags::SegmentAlphabetChange
                          | onmt::Tokenizer::Flags::NoSubstitution
                          | onmt::Tokenizer::Flags::SupportPriorJoiners,
                          "",
                          "");
tokenizer.add_alphabet_to_segment("Han");
tokenizer.add_alphabet_to_segment("Kanbun");
tokenizer.add_alphabet_to_segment("Katakana");
tokenizer.add_alphabet_to_segment("Hiragana");
```

Also - the tokens are normalized:
* NFC encoding
* lowercase (if `cas` penalty-token is activated)
* ID and values of placeholders are removed, and all `it_...` placeholders normalized by `｟it｠`. These placeholders are removed from index if `tag` penalty-token is activated
* numbers replaced by `｟ent_num｠` (if `nbr` penalty-token is activated)
* punctuations are removed from index if `pct` penalty-token is activated

It is possible to pre-tokenize and pre-normalize with other algorithms for possible special processing.

The actual tokenization is not important but needs to be consistent for indexation and lookup.

Also, the more generous is the "normalization", the better the fuzzy matcher will be able to match variants of the same sentence.

Fuzzy matching is performed on normalized forms, but final score is calculated on real forms with potential penalties.


## Suffix Arrays, BM25 and Edit distance

### Suffix Arrays

The base structure used for fuzzy matching index is a suffix array.
Its role is to act as a filter to avoid computing edit distance with every single candidate. We identify the candidates containing a common n-gram with the query (pattern) that covers at least a certain ratio and has a minimal length.
The structure of suffix array is implemented in `suffix-array.hh`and works as following: each sentence can be seen as a sequence of suffix. For instance the sentence `A B C A D` is containing suffixes `A B C A D`, `B C A D`, `C A D`, `A D` and `D`. In a suffix array the suffix are sorted by lexicographical order and suffixes are simply indicated as their position in the sentence.

The suffix array corresponding to the sentences 0: `A B C A D` and 1: `D A B A` is:

| Suffix ID | SentenceID,Position | Equivalent Suffix |
| --------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| 0 | 1,3 | `A` |
| 1 | 1,1 | `A B A` |
| 2 | 0,0 | `A B C A D` |
| 3 | 0,3 | `A D` |
| 4 | 1,2 | `B A` |
| 5 | 0,1 | `B C A D` |
| 6 | 0,2 | `C A D` |
| 7 | 0,4 | `D` |
| 8 | 1,0 | `D A B A` |

What needs to be saved is only pair of (sentence id, position), and the actual sentences. This is implemented in `SuffixArray` class through:

```cpp
struct SuffixView
{
  unsigned sentence_id;
  unsigned short subsentence_pos;
};

...

// ordered sequence of sentence id, pos in sentence
std::vector<SuffixView>       _suffixes;
// the concatenated sentences, as 0-terminated sequences of vocab
std::vector<unsigned>         _sentence_buffer;
// sentence id > position in sentence buffer
std::vector<unsigned>         _sentence_pos;
/* index first word in _sentences */
std::vector<unsigned>         _quickVocabAccess;
```

Suffix arrays have the nice property of instantly locating sub-matches from a pattern. For instance when searching common ngrams with the pattern `A B A D` - we can simply iterate at each position of the pattern and perform *narrowing* lookup in the suffix array:

1st position:
* `A` finds the matching range [0, 3] in the suffix array
* `A B` we can narrow previous range, and find new range [1, 2]
* `A B A` - 0 result

2nd position:
* `B` => range [4, 5]
* `B A` => range [4, 4]
* `B A D` - 0 result

3nd position:
* `A` => range [0, 3]
* `A D` => range [3, 3]

4th position:
* `D` => range [7, 8]

The algorithm implemented in `fuzzy-match.cc` is disregarding the unigram to avoid matching all single sentences - but then build NGramMatch for each sentence by checking longest match - in the previous case, we are keeping:

Sentence 1: `A B`, `A D`
Sentence 2: `A B A`

These occurrences might overlap, so a second step in the process is building a `pattern_map` matching all tokens covered by the ngrams while completing with unigrams.

During the match process, we can restrict the candidate sentences by looking at their length. Indeed a 70% fuzzy on a 100 tokens match can not match sentence shorter than 70 tokens or longer than 130 tokens.

### BM25

An alternative to Suffix Array algorithm is Okapi BM25. This is a ranking function using TF-IDF-like structures ([see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25)).
The idea is to only consider the k best scoring sentences as well as the sentences scoring above a certain threshold to compute edit distance on.

The indexed values of BM25 scores (term, sentence_id) are stored in a sparse matrix, requiring package Eigen. If not found, BM25 will not compile, and is not usable

### Edit distance

Last phase of the fuzzy match is to actually perform a standard edit distance between the *unnormalized* tokens to obtain actual fuzzy match.

Following rules apply to calculate the actual fuzzy match when looking for a specific pattern:
* penalty token as defined when building index `｟it｠`, punctuations are not taken into account in the real pattern length: hence `aa ｟it｠ bb cc dd` length is 4 tokens. Separators are never taken into account.
* modification, insertion, and substitution costs in edit distance are 100/real_pattern_length.
* cost of _penalty tokens_ is `cost_penalty=1`
* cost of case difference is `cost_diff_case=1`
* cost of any other difference in real forms is `cost_diff_real=2` (for instance number)

### Note on Penalties

Fuzzy-Matching score is not formally defined - and the above-mentionned rules are a reasonnable choice that can be however different than for another implementation:

* https://www.tm-town.com/fr/blog/the-fuzziness-of-fuzzy-matches
* https://wordfast.com/WFP2/Managing_projects/Defining_penalties.htm

### Suffix Arrays efficiency

Searching for a n-gram in a collection of N sentences, with average length *m*, is only costing *O(log(Nm))* since the suffix array is sorted. So the approximate number of operations required to find for all of the n-gram in a sentence of sentence *m* is only *O(m.log(Nm))*.

Note that this very nice property of the Suffix Array representation is balanced by an important cost when computing the Suffix Array. Adding a single sentence needs to insert suffixes position inside the array. Today the structure `SuffixArray` is not dynamic: it is necessary to sort completely the suffix array every time a new sentence is added, and it is not possible to remove a sentence from the index.
This could be changed, and we could dynamically insert suffixes where they belong, and also _remove_ a given sentence by searching for all its suffixes. However cost to add or remove a sentence is *O(N)*. 

### Serialization/Deserialization of Fuzzy Match Index

Serialization and Deserialization of Fuzzy Match Index classes in file is performed using functions in `include/fuzzy/fuzzy_matcher_binarization.hh`:

```
  void export_binarized_fuzzy_matcher(const std::string& binarized_tm_filename, const FuzzyMatch& fuzzy_matcher);
  void import_binarized_fuzzy_matcher(const std::string& binarized_tm_filename, FuzzyMatch& fuzzy_matcher);
```

These functions are saving/loading fuzzy_matcher instance into the indicated file - adding a signature to the file corresponding to `FMIv` where `v` is the version of the class:

```
  const char FuzzyMatch::version = '1';
```

Note that the version of the class is necessary for checking version compatibility. The serialization format may also change - and in that case is indicated with `BOOST_CLASS_VERSION` macro in `fuzzy_match.hxx`.
